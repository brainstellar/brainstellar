You can ask me 2 sums of these numbers with any integer coefficients - $(a, b, c)$. That is, you give me a, b and c and I tell you the result of the expression $a*x+b*y+c*z$. Seeing the answer, you then give me the 2nd triplet of $(a,b,c)$ & I will tell $a*x+b*y+c*z$. Give me the algorithm to find $x$, $y$ and $z$.","questionImage":null,"hint":"If digits are small, we can solve any number of variables by asking $a=1, b=10^{100}, c=10^{200}$ etc. just by reading these numbers between the zeros of result.","answer":null,"solution":"Since they are natural numbers, if you knew the maximum number of digits any of them can have, say d, you could set a=1, b=10^d, c=10^2d, and you would be able to read the d-digit numbers directly. So, you use the first calculation to find the maximum number of digits, $(a,b,c)=(1,1,1)$.  let $d =$ digits of this result $(x+y+z)$\n Then, set $(a,b,c) = (1, 10^d, 10^{2d})$ Let the sum be $S$.\n Then $x =$ (first $d$ digits of $S$), $y = [d+1]$ to $2d$-digits of S, $z$ = $[2d+1$ to $3d]$ digits of $S$\n\n Thus, we note that its posssible to solve for n natural numbers $x_1,x_2,...x_n$ with just $2$ questions.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":122,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/general/29","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/general/1019","category":"general"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
