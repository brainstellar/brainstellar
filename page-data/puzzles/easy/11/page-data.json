Your task is to draw the minimum number of socks at random to be sure you have a pair of a single color. How many socks should you draw?","questionImage":null,"hint":"Pigeonhole principle","answer":"3","solution":"This is the easiest example of a very powerful tool called the Pigeonhole principal, which says that if there are (N+1) pigeons to fit in N holes, atleast one hole will have 2 or more pigeons. Hence, if you pick 3 socks to come with 2 color categories, at least one category will have 2 or more socks, i.e. a pair is guaranteed with either red or black color.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":11,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/10","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/12","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
