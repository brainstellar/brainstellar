He meets a pair of twins at a fork in the road: one path leads to the jungle, the other to the mystic. One of the twins always says the truth, the other always lies.

So if the answer is 'Yes', the road on the left indeed leads to the mystic, otherwise the road on the right does so.\n\n(solution was taken from gurmeet's blog)","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":16,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/15","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/17","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
