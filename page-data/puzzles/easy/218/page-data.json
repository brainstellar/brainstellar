At time 0, the spy is at location A.  With each time interval, the spy moves B units to the right (if B is negative, the spy is moving left).  A and B are fixed integers, but they are unknown to you.  You are to catch the spy.  The means by which you can attempt to do that is:  at each time interval (starting at time 0), you can choose a location on the line and ask whether or not the spy is currently at that location.  That is, you will ask a question like \"Is the spy currently at location 27?\" and you will get a yes/no answer.  Devise an algorithm that will eventually find the spy</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":218,"difficulty":"hard","category":"strategy","title":"Catching the Spy"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":218,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/hard/217","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/hard/220","difficulty":"hard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
