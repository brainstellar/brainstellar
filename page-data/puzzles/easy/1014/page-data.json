They all have an even number of candies (not necessarily equal). When the teacher blows a whistle, each student passes half his candies to the student on his left. Then the students who have an odd number of candies obtain an extra candy from the teacher. Show that after a finite number of whistles, all students have the same number of candies.</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Look at minimum &#x26; maximum count of candies.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The maximum number of candies held by a single student can never increase.</li>\n<li>The minimum number of candies held by a single student always strictly increases, unless the student to his right also has the minimum number of candies, in which case the length of the longest consecutive segment of students who have minimum number of candies strictly decreases. Thus eventually the minimum has to strictly increase.</li>\n<li>Since the minimum has to strictly increase in a finite number of steps and cannot go beyond the maximum, all the numbers must eventually be equal in atmost n(max-min) steps.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":1014,"difficulty":"medium","category":"discrete","title":"Candy Game"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":1014,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/1013","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/1015","difficulty":"medium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
