Since e^x = 1 + xâ€¦., we have e^x>1+x. Now, conveneintly choosing x = (Pi / e -1) and solving, we get e^Pi > Pi^e.\n\nAnother way is to observe for f(x) = x^(1/x), differentiating: f'(x) = f(x)*(1/x^2)*(1- ln x);  f is decreasing for x > e so pi^(1/pi) < e^(1/e); hence e^(pi)> pi^(e)\n\nAnother approach is to assume e^Pi > Pi^e <=> Pi*lne > e*ln Pi <=> lne/e > lnPi/Pi. Now, notice that f(x) = lnx/x is decreasing function since f'(x) is negative in range (e<x<pi), hence above assumption is true!","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":22,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/21","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/23","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
