Using this specific configuration, find a special configuration of 400 coins which covers the table with overlaps.</p>\n<p>Covering means for every point on table there is a coin above it.</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Create coins of radius 2 from the center of all coins. Notice that these coins fill up entire table, they are just bigger than what we are given.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Consider just one of these coins, with center P. It follows that the center Q of any other coin cannot lie within the coin of radius 2 with center P because it must be at least 2 units away. Thus, we construct all of these coins of radius 2, concurrent with each of the coins of radius 1. If the set of coins of radius 2 did not cover the rectangle entirely, then we could place a coin of radius 1 in this region, contradiction. Thus, the set of coins of radius 2 entirely covers the rectangle.</p>\n<p>We now have 100 coins of radius 2 that entirely covers the rectangle. Scale this by a factor of 1/2 in both planar dimensions. Now we have 100 coins of radius 1 that entirely covers a rectangle that is a quadrant of the original rectangle. By placing four of these sets together, we get 400 coins of radius 1 that entirely covers the original rectangle.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":1015,"difficulty":"medium","category":"discrete","title":"Overlapping Coins"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":1015,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/1014","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/1016","difficulty":"medium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
