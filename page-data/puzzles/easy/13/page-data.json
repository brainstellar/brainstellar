Given that p(1h)=3/4 => p(0.5h)=1/2 and p(2h)=15/16.\nThe way we have defined p(t) above, it is the probability that at least 1 accident happens in time interval t. Thus, as t increases, p(t) increases.\nIf, instead, p(t) is defined as the fraction of vehicles that met with an accident in time interval t, then again p(2t)=p(t)+(1-p(t)) * p(t)=1-(1-p(t))^2</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":13,"difficulty":"easy","category":"probability","title":"Accidents in Half Time"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":13,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/12","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/14","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
