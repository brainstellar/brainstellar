With what probability can it form a triangle?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>All three broken parts must satisfy the triangle inequality. Or rather, each of the broken part must be less than half of stick's length.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>1/4</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>All 3 sides have to have lengths less than half the length of the stick. the conditions are min{ x.y}&#x3C;= 0.5; max{x,y}>=0.5; |x-y|&#x3C;=0.5 . looking at the unit square, and dividing into 8 congruent triangles by lines parallel to the axes and y=x line, its easy to see 2 of the 8 triangles satisfy the condition. so the answer is 1/4</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":102,"difficulty":"medium","category":"probability","title":"Stick to Triangle"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":102,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/101","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/103","difficulty":"medium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
