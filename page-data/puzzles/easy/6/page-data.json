First time, N/2 girls and N/2 boys are born (ignoring aberrations). N/2 couples retire, and rest half try another child. Next time, N/4 couples give birth to N/4 girls and rest N/4 boys. Thus, even in second iteration, ratio is 1:1. It can now be seen that this ratio always remain same, no matter how many times people try to give birth to a favored gender.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":6,"difficulty":"easy","category":"probability","title":"All Girls World?"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":6,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/5","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/7","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
