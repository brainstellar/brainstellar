The barrel has a capacity of 6. The gun is fired once, but no bullet is shot. Does rolling the barrel (shuffling) before next shot increase the probability of firing a bullet?","questionImage":"rolling_bullet.png","hint":"Since the bullets are loaded consecutively, the next shot is also constrained.","answer":"Yes, shuffling increases the probability of firing a bullet.","solution":" If the two bullets are randomly put instead of consecutively, then, after firing one empty shot, there are $2$ bullets and $5$ total slots. The probability would be $2/5 = 40\\%$, but that's not the case here.\n Actually, the probability of firing a bullet without a shuffle is $1/4 = 25\\%$. To understand this, imagine that the firing pin was on one of the empty slots $(3, 4, 5, 6)$, and the first shot was taken, but no bullet was fired. Now assumming that the barrel rotates clockwise, the pin will move to one of these slots: $(2, 3, 4, 5)$. Out of these four slots, only the slot $(1)$ has a bullet. Hence probability of firing a bullet is $1/4 = 25\\%$.\n Note that the same is true in anti-clockwise direction.\n\n After the shuffle, the state is reset. There are $6$ total slots with $2$ bullets, the probabilty of firing a bullet after a shuffle is $2/6 = 1/3 \\approx 33\\% $.\n\n Thus, shuffling does increase the probability of firing a bullet (from $25\\%$ to $33\\%$)\n\n ","solutionImage":"rolling_bullet_a.png"}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":1,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/1020","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
