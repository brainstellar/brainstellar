How do we get a fair toss from this? That is, how do we toss this coin in such a way that we can have probability of winning = loosing = 50%?","questionImage":null,"hint":"Clearly we cannot have a fair toss in a single flip of this coin. But by tossing this coin 2 times, we can assign the outputs to \"win\" or \"loose\", such that we have a 50% chance for both.","answer":"Toss 2 times, mapping HT to \"win\", TH to \"loose\" and repeat the process otherwise.","solution":"Toss the coin twice. If consecutive Heads-Tails appears (HT), we \"win\". In case of (TH), we \"loose\". If (TT) or (HH) appears, repeat the process. Probability of infinite repetition (p*p*.....) + (1-p)*(1-p)*.... = 0 + 0 = 0;\n\nProbability of H-T and T-H is equal hence it's fair now.\n\nI proposed a faster method, \"lets keep tossing the coin to form a sequence of H's & T's . I win if HT appears before TH\" . Was I bluffing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActually yes, the probability of HT before TH is just p in second game.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":19,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/18","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/20"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
