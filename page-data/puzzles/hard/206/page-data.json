You get a coupon with each purchase of a soda, and each coupon is equally likely. Whatâ€™s the expected number of soda bottles you have to buy in order to collect all the coupons?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Linearity of expectation</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Divide the whole process in to stages. Each stage ends with collecting a coupon which is new ( different from the coupons we already have )</p>\n<p>Let C_i be the random variable which denotes the number of coupons we buy in the stage i.</p>\n<p>Let C be the random variable which denotes the number of coupons we buy in order to get all n coupons\nNow,\nC= C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_n\nNote C_1 = 1;\nIn general, while we are during stage i , we already have with us (i-1) different coupons. So, the probability of getting a new coupon is p_i = n-(i-1)/n. Also note that each C_i is a Geometrically distributed random variable with success probability equal to p_i. So, E(C_i) = 1/p_i = n/(n-i+1).\nBy using Linearity of Expectations,\nE(C) = E(C_1) +E(C_2) + ...+E(C_n)\n= n(1/n + 1/(n-1)+ ... +1)\n~ nlogn.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":206,"difficulty":"hard","category":"probability","title":"Collecting Lucky coupons"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":206,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/hard/205","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/hard/207","difficulty":"hard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
