A certain amount of water is transferred to the wine, then the same amount of the mixture is transferred back to the water. Is there now more water in the wine than there is wine in the water?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>Equal!</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>The main point is that the final volumes of mixture liquids are equal. This means in jar A, volume of water + wine is same as that in jar B. Assume original volume as L. Suppose final volume in jar A is x for water and (L-x) for wine. This implies that jar B has x amount of wine and (L-x) of water. This proves that there are equal amounts of water in the wine jar and wine in the water jar.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":17,"difficulty":"easy","category":"general","title":"Water & Wine"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":17,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/16","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/18","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
