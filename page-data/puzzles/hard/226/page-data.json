Imagine each of these mini cubes is either fully red or fully blue such that it forms a 3D checkerboard pattern on the box. This will restrict 14-13 restriction on cube colors, say 14 blue and 13 red. Now, putting bricks into box, parallel to faces, each brick will be half blue and half red, so 52 bricks fill all the red cubes and there is no way to place a 53rd brick.
