How do we get a fair toss from this? That is, how do we toss this coin in such a way that we can have probability of winning = loosing = 50%?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Clearly we cannot have a fair toss in a single flip of this coin. But by tossing this coin 2 times, we can assign the outputs to \"win\" or \"loose\", such that we have a 50% chance for both.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>Toss 2 times, mapping HT to \"win\", TH to \"loose\" and repeat the process otherwise.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Toss the coin twice. If consecutive Heads-Tails appears (HT), we \"win\". In case of (TH), we \"loose\". If (TT) or (HH) appears, repeat the process. Probability of infinite repetition (p * p * .....) + (1-p) * (1-p) * .... = 0 + 0 = 0;</p>\n<p>Probability of H-T and T-H is equal hence it's fair now.</p>\n<p>I proposed a faster method, \"lets keep tossing the coin to form a sequence of H's &#x26; T's . I win if HT appears before TH\" . Was I bluffing?</p>\n<p>Actually yes, the probability of HT before TH is just p in second game.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":19,"difficulty":"easy","category":"probability","title":"Getting fair result from unfair coin"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":19,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/18","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/20","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
