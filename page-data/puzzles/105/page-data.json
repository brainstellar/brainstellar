We can get a 1-1 mapping from N to NxN\nHence, we can accommodate (infinite people X infinite buses) in the hotel.\n\nRelevant article:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_pairing_function","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":105,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/104","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/106"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
