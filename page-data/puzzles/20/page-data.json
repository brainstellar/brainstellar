After every mission, he rushes to the central subway. Since spidey is a nice man, much impartial, he takes which-ever train arrives first. From subway, one series go towards Mary's place, and another series move towards Stacy. Trains from either series appear every 10 minutes. Also, Peter Parker sticks with the train which arrives first.\nBut somehow, he notices that he is spending 9 times more dates with Mary Jane than Stacy. Can you explain why?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Do you think ratio should be 50:50? Do you think the gap between each train's arrival is 5 minutes? Can a train arrive always earlier than the other and still be at every 10 minutes gap?</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Train to Mary Jane's place comes at say times 0 and 10, while the train to Stacy's place comes at times 1 and 11. So 9/10 times, train to Mary Jane's place is appearing earlier.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":20,"difficulty":"easy","category":"probability","title":"Waiting for the Train"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":20,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/19","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/21"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
