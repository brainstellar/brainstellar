The rabbit can hop up only one or two stairs at a time. What kind of sequence is depicted by the different ways possible for the rabbit to ascend to the top of the stairs of length n=1,2,3...?","questionImage":null,"hint":"Recursion","answer":"Fibonacci Sequence.","solution":"Suppose f(n) are the number of ways to reach nth stair. Notice that the final hop is either a single jump or double jump, i.e. its from (n-1)th stair or (n-2)th. Thus f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), where f(0)=f(1)=1.  This is Fibonacci sequence.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":103,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/102","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/104"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
