Take Earth radius 1.\n\nClarification: Shortest distance cuts through the sphere, instead of lying on surface.\n\nFurther thinking: Is this question same as choosing two random points on unit sphere and asking their expected distance?\n","questionImage":null,"hint":"Imagine a ring of some thickness, whose distance from N is constant from all points on that ring. Get the average of all such rings.","answer":"4/3","solution":" 2*sin(x/2)is the distance of north pole from a point on the ring at angle x from the z axis. So, integrate from 0 to pi, (2*pi*sin(x)*2*sin(x/2) dx) and divide by the total area which is 4*pi.\nAnswer:4/3\n\nAnother approach is to imagine a horizontal ring of dy thickness at distance y from N (north pole). \n\nArea of ring = 2*pi*dy\nProbability of choosing point on this ring = dy/2\nDistance of N & a point on ring = sqrt(2y)\n\nExp length = integral (y=0 to 2) of sqrt(2y) dy/2 = 4/3\n\nAnd yes, taking two random points on surface of sphere and asking their expected distance is same as this very question.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":203,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/202","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/204","category":"probability"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
