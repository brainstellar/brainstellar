With what probability can it form a triangle?","questionImage":null,"hint":"All three broken parts must satisfy the triangle inequality. Or rather, each of the broken part must be less than half of stick's length.","answer":"1/4","solution":"All 3 sides have to have lengths less than half the length of the stick. the conditions are min{ x.y}<= 0.5; max{x,y}>=0.5; |x-y|<=0.5 . looking at the unit square, and dividing into 8 congruent triangles by lines parallel to the axes and y=x line, its easy to see 2 of the 8 triangles satisfy the condition. so the answer is 1/4","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":102,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/101","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/106","category":"probability"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
