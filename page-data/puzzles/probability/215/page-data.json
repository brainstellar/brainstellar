You start a random walk with equal probability of moving left or right one step at a time. What is the probability that you will reach point a before reaching point -b? What is the expected number of steps to reach either a or -b? (a,b are natural numbers)","questionImage":null,"hint":null,"answer":"b/(a+b) and ab","solution":"If you try markov chain approach, this question will never end! For this problem, we will use Martingales.\nLet N = number of steps to reach any of a or -b. Let SN = X1+...+XN.  Suppose Pa = probability of touching a before -b, and Pb = the opposite. We use the fact that both SN and (SN^2-N) are martingales, thus:\n0 = E(SN) = a*Pa + (-b)*Pb\nThis gives Pa = b/(a+b)\nSimilarly, 0 = E(SN^2-N) = Pa*a^2 + Pb*b^2 - E(N)\nThis gives E(N) = ab","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":215,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/213","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/216","category":"probability"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
