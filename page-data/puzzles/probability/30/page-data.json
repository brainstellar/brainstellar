Each arrives at a random time between 0:00 and 1:00. Each one of them stays for exactly 30 minutes. On any one given night, what is the probability that the witches will meet at the coffee shop?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Graph Shading</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>3/4</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Plot the graph of X and Y, where X and Y denote the time each witch arrives. This will form a 60x60 square for total feasible region. The probability that they meet is |X-Y|&#x3C;= 30. Draw this as favorable region, by joining line (30,0) with (60,30) and (0,30) with (30,60). Clearly the interior of this region has area 3/4 th of total. Hence the probability = 3/4 = 0.75</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":30,"difficulty":"easy","category":"probability","title":"Witches at the coffee shop"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":30,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/28","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/101","category":"probability"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
