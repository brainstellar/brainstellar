In this case, the expected length of the small part is L/4. Its L/4 in the other case too. Hence E = 1/2 * L/4 + 1/2 * L/4 = L/4</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":119,"difficulty":"medium","category":"probability","title":"Breaking Stick"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":119,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/118","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/201","category":"probability"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
