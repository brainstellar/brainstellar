Third is debatable as per the interpretation. I believed 1/3, as the names Cooper used were anonymous, and should have given no extra information. But it turns out that Cooper did provide some extra information. He had actually fixed a person (A). Also, calculating the probability in part 3 using conditionals will give 1/2.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":25,"difficulty":"easy","category":"probability","title":"Daughter or Son"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":25,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/24","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/28","category":"probability"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
