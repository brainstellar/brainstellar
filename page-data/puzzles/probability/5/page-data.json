This will give a probability of (1/2) * 1 + (1/2) * (49/100) = 74.5%</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":5,"difficulty":"easy","category":"probability","title":"Lucky Candy"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":5,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/1","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/6","category":"probability"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
