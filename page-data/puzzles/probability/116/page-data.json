Recall the law of total probability,\nE(Xn) = E ( E(Xn) |Y) )\nwhere Y = current toss (either Head or tail).\nEn = (1/2)( E(Xn) | H) + (1/2)( E(Xn) | T)\nEn = (1/2)( E(X(n-1)) + 1 |H) + (1/2)( E(Xn) + 1 | T)\nthe extra 1 is because we just used a toss\nEn = 1 + (1/2)*E(n-1) + (1/2)*En\nThis above equation is logical and should be written directly.\n=> En = 2E(n-1) + 2\n\nThis simplifies to 2^(n+1)-2 as E0 = 0.
