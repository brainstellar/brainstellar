What is the expected length of the middle part?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Selecting the random point from a small 'dt' length element is dt , as length of stick=1. Now use the definition of Expectation.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>1/3</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Double integral of |x-y|dxdy gives 1/3 as answer. This is same as one would expect from a broken pencil.</p>\n<p>Palak's Solution:\nIntegrate from 0 to 1, x * x/2 + (1-x) * (1-x)/2 = 1/3\nlogic: if one cut is at distance x from left, with probability x, the second cut comes before it, and expected length of middle piece is x/2.. Similarly with prob (1-x) it, middle piece is expected to have length (1-x)/2. Thus adding and integrating from 0 to 1.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":204,"difficulty":"hard","category":"probability","title":"Expected Breakup Length"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":204,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/203","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/probability/205","category":"probability"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
