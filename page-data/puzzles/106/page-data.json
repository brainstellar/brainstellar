Three identical and unfair dice are rolled. If the booked number appears on 0, 1, 2 or 3 dice, player wins Rs 0, 1, 2 or 3 respectively, without returning the original Rs 1. What is expected money you can win after buying a ticket for Rs 1?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Book the full house</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>1/2</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>We bet Rs 1 on each number 1-6. In any case, we get Rs 3 back. That is 1/2 per ticket. Hence the expected amount of money we can win is 1/2. A tedious way to arrive at this answer is to calculate the probability of getting 1, 2 or 3 faces common to our booking.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":106,"difficulty":"medium","category":"probability","title":"Chuck a Luck"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":106,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/105","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/107"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
