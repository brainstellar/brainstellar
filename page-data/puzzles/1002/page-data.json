The bag has k black balls and 1 red ball. Winner is the one who picks the red ball. Who is more likely to win, the on who starts first, or second?","questionImage":null,"hint":"Look at k=0,1,2,3... Write down probability of starter being a winner.","answer":"Begin!","solution":" A & B keep on picking the balls without looking at their color. After all balls have been picked, the one who starts the game will have more balls (if k=even, total balls=odd) and hence higher probability of winning.\n\n\nSolution by Palak Bhushan:\n(prob of A winning in first chance = 1/(k+1)) + \n(prob of A winning in 3rd chance = (1-(1/k+1))*(1-1/k)*1/(k-1) = 1/(k+1)) + ... + \n(prob of A winning in 2r+1-th chance = 1/(k+1)) + ... .\nWhen k=2n+1, there are n+1 such terms, giving the prob as (n+1)*1/(k+1)=1/2. \nWhen k=2n, there are n+1 such terms, giving prob as (n+1)*1/(k+1)=(n+1)/(2n+1)>1/2.\nHence, doesnt matter who starts first when k is odd. \nThe first player has higher chance of winning when k is even","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":1002,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/226","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/1003"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
