The monkey will eat as many bananas as are shown on the die, from 1 to 5. But if the die shows '6', the monkey will eat 5 bananas and throw the die again. This may continue indefinitely. What is the expected number of bananas the monkey will eat?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Law of total probability</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>4</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>This uses law of total probability very silently, i.e., E( E(X|Y) ) = E(X). Suppose X expected number bananas eaten overall and Y = number shown on dice.\nE1 = E( X | Y = 1,2,3,4,5) = 3\nE2 = E( X | Y = 6) = 5 + E(X)\nnow, E(X) = 5/6 * E1 + 1/6 * E2\nSolving this simple equation gives E(X) = 4</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":115,"difficulty":"medium","category":"probability","title":"Innocent Monkey"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":115,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/114","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/116"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
