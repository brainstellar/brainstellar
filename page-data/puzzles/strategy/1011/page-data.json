When you compare two elements, one comparison is sufficient to find both min & max of those two elements.","answer":null,"solution":"Solution requires approximately 1.5n comparisons instead of 2n comparisons.\n\nBreak n numbers into pairs of 2.\nSo, that is n/2 pairs. Find maximum and minimum in each pair. Cost = n/2.\nNow given n/2 maximums, find the maximum. Cost = n/2. Given n/2 minimums, find the minimum. Cost = n/2\n\nSo, overall cost 3n/2 comparisons.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":1011,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/strategy/222","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/strategy/1012","category":"strategy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
