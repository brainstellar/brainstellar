At time 0, the spy is at location A.  With each time interval, the spy moves B units to the right (if B is negative, the spy is moving left).  A and B are fixed integers, but they are unknown to you.  You are to catch the spy.  The means by which you can attempt to do that is:  at each time interval (starting at time 0), you can choose a location on the line and ask whether or not the spy is currently at that location.  That is, you will ask a question like \"Is the spy currently at location 27?\" and you will get a yes/no answer.  Devise an algorithm that will eventually find the spy","questionImage":null,"hint":null,"answer":null,"solution":null,"solutionImage":"<a href=\"http://g0rg0nz0l4.blogspot.in/2010/11/catching-spy-and-infinity.html\">Here is a detailed solution with images</a>\n\n<br/><br/>\nAnd here is a short solution by Palak Bhushan<br/>\nsince integer 2-tuples (x,y) are countable, there exists a function f:N->N*N such that f covers all integer 2-tuples. Let f(n)=(f1(n),f2(n)). The algorithm will be to check for location f1(n)+n*f2(n) at time instant n. Given A and B, there exists n0 such that f(n0)=(f1(n0),f2(n0))=(A,B), and thus at time instant n0 we will be checking for location f1(n0)+n0*f2(n0) which is =A+B*n0 -- the actual location of the spy."}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":218,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/strategy/217","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/strategy/220","category":"strategy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
