Third is debatable as per the interpretation. I believed 1/3, as the names Cooper used were anonymous, and should have given no extra information. But it turns out that Cooper did provide some extra information. He had actually fixed a person (A). Also, calculating the probability in part 3 using conditionals will give 1/2.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":25,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/24","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/26"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
