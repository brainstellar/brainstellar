Some are moving towards left, and some towards right. If a collision occurs between two zombies, they both reverse their direction. Initially all zombies are standing at 1 unit intervals. For every zombie, you can see whether it moves left or right, can you predict the number of collisions?","questionImage":null,"hint":"On every collision, assume that the two zombies don't reverse direction but simply cross each other.","answer":null,"solution":"Since we can assume that zombies can pass through each other, for a zombie moving right, count the number of zombies to its right moving left. Add this number for every right moving zombie. That is the number of collisions.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":129,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/discrete/128","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/discrete/130","category":"discrete"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
