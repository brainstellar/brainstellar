What is the volume of this intersection?","questionImage":null,"hint":null,"answer":"16/3","solution":"If you cut the intersection by a horizontal plane at distance z from center, the cut will be a square with side-length 2*sqrt( 1-z^2). Integrate to get volume 16/3.\n\nAnother way is to imagine the largest possible sphere inscribed at the center of intersection. The sphere should have a radius of 1. At each cut perpendicular to the z-axis, the circle from the sphere is inscribed in the square from the intersection as well, So Area of cut-circle = (Pi/4)*Area of cut-square. This is true for all z, hence Volume of sphere = (Pi/4)*Volume of Intersection, this also gives 16/3","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":1018,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/discrete/1017","nextPuzzleRoute":null,"category":"discrete"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
