When ever a collision of two different fruits occurs, they both get converted into the third type. For example 1 Apple and 1 Banana can collide to form 2 cherries. No other collision is holy. Can a sequence of such magical collisions lead all 45 fruits to give just one type?","questionImage":null,"hint":"This can't be done. Try to create a function of A,B,C which remains constant during a collision to get contradiction.","answer":null,"solution":"Create the invariant function f(A,B,C) = (0A+1B+2C)mod3, this function remains constant during a collision. But f(13,15,17) = 1 is not same as any of final states f(45,0,0)=f(0,45,0)=f(0,0,45)=0. Hence this can not be done.\n\nA refreshment to this old trick was given by Aritro Pathak:\ncall the no of times apples are increased by 2 as A, bananas increased by 2 as B, and cherries increased by 2 as C. if we need 45 apples,total increments - decrements of apple = 32\nbut increments of apple = 2*A;\nwhen ever 2 banana's are created, 1 Apple is lost, similarly for 2 cherries\ndecrements = B+C\n\nthus we have 2A-B-C=32, -2B+C+A=15, -2C+B+A=17. Subtract the last two to get 2=3*(B-C) which is impossible. similar cases for when you want 45 of either cherries or bananas.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":124,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/discrete/123","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/discrete/125","category":"discrete"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
