Hence, if you pick 3 socks to come with 2 color categories, at least one category will have 2 or more socks, i.e. a pair is guaranteed with either red or black color.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":11,"difficulty":"easy","category":"discrete","title":"Pair of Socks"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":11,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/discrete/3","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/discrete/12","category":"discrete"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
