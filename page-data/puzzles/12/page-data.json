T(x) is the temp at the point x .. let f(x)=T(x)-T(x+pi), then f(0)=T(0)-T(pi)..f(pi)=T(pi)-T(2pi)=T(pi)-T(0) then f(0) and f(pi) have different signs, so using mean value theorem, you have that f is 0 at some point.</p>\n<p>FunFact: There are uncountable number of such pairs.</p>\n<p>Here is a video explanation:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Px6fajpSio\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Px6fajpSio</a></p>\n<p>An alternate version of this puzzle is the Mountain Man\n<a href=\"http://www.techinterview.org/post/521419748/mountain-man\">http://www.techinterview.org/post/521419748/mountain-man</a></p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":12,"difficulty":"easy","category":"discrete","title":"Antipodal points"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":12,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/11","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/13"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
