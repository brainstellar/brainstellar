Let X_i be a random variable taking value 1 if i_th position has a colour change and zero otherwise.\n\nWe have to find expected value of E[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_99]\n\nSince all X_i are equivalent, the answer is 99*E[X_i]\n\nE[X_i] = ((50/100)*(50/99)+(50/100)*(50/99)) = 50/99\n\nSo, Answer is 50.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":1020,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/1019","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
