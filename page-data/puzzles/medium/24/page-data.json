You know that regular die has integers 1 to 6, but don't know what's on the invisible dice. After tossing, I speak the sum of outcome of both die. It so happens that the outcome is an interger between 1 to 12, with equal probability (1/12 each). Can you guess what are the numbers printed on special invisible dice?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>For the sum to be 1, we need atleast 0, and for sum to be 12, what do we need? Can you guess the digits of invisible dice now?</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>0 0 0 6 6 6</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Faces of cube have numbers: 0 0 0 6 6 6 . If we compute conditional probability, we get 0 with probabilty (1/2) and 6 with probability (1/2). Hence the sum is 1,2....12 with probability of (1/12) each</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":24,"difficulty":"easy","category":"probability","title":"Invisible Dice"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":24,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/23","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/25","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
