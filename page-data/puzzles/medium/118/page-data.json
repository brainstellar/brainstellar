What is the expected number of HH? Note that in HHH, number of HH = 2. (eg: expected number of HH in 2 tosses is 0.25, 3 tosses is 0.5)</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Recursion</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Let the expected number of HH for n tossed is E(n). So, probability that an (n-1) toss experiments, ends in T is 1/2.\nSo, E(n) = 1/2 * E(n-1) + 1/2 * ( 1/2 * (E(n-1)+1) + 1/2 * (E(n-1)))\n(The first case when it ends in T. &#x26; The second case when it ends in H.\nIn the second case, if you get an H then, you get 1 more HH. )\nSo, E(n) = E(n-1) + 1/4, us E(2) = 1/4\nSo, E(n) = (n-1)/4\nFor n=10, E(10) = 2.25</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":118,"difficulty":"medium","category":"probability","title":"Number of Double Heads"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":118,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/117","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/119","difficulty":"medium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
