What is the probability that there are at least 1 blue candy and 1 green candy left in the jar when you have taken out all the red candies? (Candies of same color are indistinguishable!)</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Combinatorial problem. Consider a sequence of 60 candies, in which red candies finish before blue and green.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>7/12</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>It can be done using combinatorics as well as conditional probability.
