Some are moving towards left, and some towards right. If a collision occurs between two zombies, they both reverse their direction. Initially all zombies are standing at 1 unit intervals. For every zombie, you can see whether it moves left or right, can you predict the number of collisions?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>On every collision, assume that the two zombies don't reverse direction but simply cross each other.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Since we can assume that zombies can pass through each other, for a zombie moving right, count the number of zombies to its right moving left. Add this number for every right moving zombie. That is the number of collisions.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":129,"difficulty":"medium","category":"discrete","title":"Dead Men Walking"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":129,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/128","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/130","difficulty":"medium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
