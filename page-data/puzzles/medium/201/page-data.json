A run is number of blocks of consecutive cards of the same color. For example, a sequence RRRRBBBRBRB of only 11 cards has 6 runs; namely, RRRR, BBB, R, B, R, B. Find the expected number of runs in a shuffled deck of cards.</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Linearity of expectation</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>27</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>We form the answer for general deck of 2n cards, with n red cards and n black cards. Consider any sequence X1,X2..X2n (of R &#x26; B). Now define  Y1 = 1;\nYi = 1 if Xi and X(i-1) are of different colors\nYi = 0 otherwise.</p>\n<p>We want to find E[Y1 + ..+ Y2n], using linearity of expectation, = E(Y1) +...+E(Yn). Now note that, E[Y1] = 1 and E[Yi] = E[Yj] for the rest (by symmetry)</p>\n<p>Also E[Yi] = E(Y2) = P(X2 is diff from X1) =  (number of ways first two are RB or BR) / (Total number of orientations) = 2 * [ (2n-2)choose(n-1) ] / [ 2n choose n ] = n/(2n-1)</p>\n<p>Ans = 1+(2n-1) * E[Y_i] = n+1</p>\n<p>This is 27 for deck of 52 cards.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":201,"difficulty":"hard","category":"probability","title":"Colored Runs of Cards"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":201,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/hard/22","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/hard/202","difficulty":"hard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
