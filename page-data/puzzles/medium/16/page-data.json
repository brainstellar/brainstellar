He meets a pair of twins at a fork in the road: one path leads to the jungle, the other to the mystic. One of the twins always says the truth, the other always lies. What yes/no question should he ask one of the twins to determine the path that goes to the mystic?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Ask one about the other!</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>The two-brother problem may be solved in two different ways:\nThe traveler may ask, \"Would your brother agree that the road on the left leads to the mystic?\" The answer is guaranteed to be 'Yes' if and only if the road on the right leads to the mystic.\nThe traveler may ask, \"If I were to ask you whether the road on the left leads to the mystic, would you say 'Yes'?\" The 'if i were to ask you' construct makes both twins tell the truth. So if the answer is 'Yes', the road on the left indeed leads to the mystic, otherwise the road on the right does so.</p>\n<p>(solution was taken from gurmeet's blog)</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":16,"difficulty":"easy","category":"strategy","title":"Fork in Road"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":16,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/15","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/17","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
