Finding minimum takes n-1 comparisons. Finding maximum takes n-1 comparisons. If you had to simultaneously find both minimum and maximum, can you do it in less than 2n-2 comparisons?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>the answer is ~1.5n calculations. It uses a trick. When you compare two elements, one comparison is sufficient to find both min &#x26; max of those two elements.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Solution requires approximately 1.5n comparisons instead of 2n comparisons.</p>\n<p>Break n numbers into pairs of 2.\nSo, that is n/2 pairs. Find maximum and minimum in each pair. Cost = n/2.\nNow given n/2 maximums, find the maximum. Cost = n/2. Given n/2 minimums, find the minimum. Cost = n/2</p>\n<p>So, overall cost 3n/2 comparisons.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":1011,"difficulty":"medium","category":"strategy","title":"Min & Max"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":1011,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/1006","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/1013","difficulty":"medium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
