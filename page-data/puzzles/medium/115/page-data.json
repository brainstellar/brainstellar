The monkey will eat as many bananas as are shown on the die, from 1 to 5. But if the die shows '6', the monkey will eat 5 bananas and throw the die again. This may continue indefinitely. What is the expected number of bananas the monkey will eat?","questionImage":null,"hint":"Law of total probability","answer":"4","solution":"This uses law of total probability very silently, i.e., E( E(X|Y) ) = E(X). Suppose X expected number bananas eaten overall and Y = number shown on dice.\nE1 = E( X | Y = 1,2,3,4,5) = 3\nE2 = E( X | Y = 6) = 5 + E(X)\nnow, E(X) = 5/6*E1 + 1/6*E2\nSolving this simple equation gives E(X) = 4","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":115,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/114","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/116","difficulty":"medium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
