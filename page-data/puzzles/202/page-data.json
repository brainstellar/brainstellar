The ant is drunk and from any corner, it moves randomly by choosing any edge!

This should give 4 equivalent merged vertices, with 1st being start & 4th being destination.","answer":null,"solution":"Let the expected number of step required to go from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) be E0.Also let expected number of step required to reach (1,1,1) from (0,0,1)(Or from (0,1,0) or from (1,0,0)) be E1. similarly expected number of step required to reach (1,1,1) from (0,1,1) (Or from (1,0,1) or from (1,1,0)) be E2.Then we can write:\nE0=1/3(E1+E1+E1)+1\nE1= 1/3*E0 + 2/3*E2 + 1\nE2 = 2/3*E1 + 1\nsolving this we find E0 as 10.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":202,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/201","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/203"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
