It travels with a constant engine speed and there is no wind. Will its travel time for the same round trip be greater, less or the same if, throughout both flights, at the same engine speed, a constant wind blows from A to B?\n","questionImage":null,"hint":null,"answer":"Wind will always slow down the journey!","solution":"The time during which the plane's speed is boosted is shorter than the time during which it is retarded, so the over-all effect is of retardation. Consider the example when plane's speed is same as wind. In one direction, plane's speed doubles, while in the other, it becomes zero! (i.e. it takes infinte time to finish the journey!)\n","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":9,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/8","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/10"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
