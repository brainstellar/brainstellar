The rabbit can hop up only one or two stairs at a time.

Notice that the final hop is either a single jump or double jump, i.e. its from (n-1)th stair or (n-2)th. Thus f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), where f(0)=f(1)=1.  This is Fibonacci sequence.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":103,"difficulty":"medium","category":"discrete","title":"Rabbit on the Staircase"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":103,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/102","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/104","difficulty":"medium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
