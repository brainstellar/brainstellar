In order to estimate the average size of a clan, a survey is conducted where 1000 randomly selected people are asked to state the size of the clan to which they belong.  How does one compute an estimate average clan size from the data collected?","questionImage":null,"hint":null,"answer":null,"solution":"This is more of a puzzle-to-ponder rather than a puzzle to learn. In my opinion, best estimator for average is sum( n )/ sum( #n/n), where #n is the number of people with clan size as 'n', and this sum is over all the values of 'n' we receive.","solutionImage":null}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":1009,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/deadly/1008","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/deadly/1012","difficulty":"deadly"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
