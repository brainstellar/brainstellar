He says, \"OK, we'll take turns putting one penny down, no overlapping allowed, and the pennies must rest flat on the table surface. The first guy who can't put a penny down loses.\" You can go first. How will you guarantee victory?</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>Try the problem if coins have unit radii, and table has radius 1 &#x26; 3.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>You place a penny right in the center of the table. After that, whenever the devil places a penny on the table, mimic his placement by placing a penny diametrically opposite and at same distance from center. If he has a place to place a penny, so will you. The devil will run out of places to put a quarter before you do.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":29,"difficulty":"easy","category":"general","title":"Devil's Penny"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":29,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/28","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/easy/30","difficulty":"easy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
