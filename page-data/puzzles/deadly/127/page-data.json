At time t, you examine bulb number t, and if it’s on, you change the state of bulb t + 1 (modulo n); i.e., you turn it off if it’s on, and on if it’s off. If bulb t is off, you do nothing. Prove that if you continue around and around the ring in this manner, eventually all the bulbs will again be on.</p>\n<h2>Hint</h2>\n<p>It doesn't matter what the rules are, only thing that matters is that all bulbs should not go off!</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Suppose every orientation of light bulbs &#x26; position of current pointer (t modulo n) forms a different state. Since all bulbs don’t go off, we must repeat a state after finite number of steps. Also notice that every state has a unique pre-state. Suppose the two states are at time T1 &#x26; T2. Notice that at time 0 all bulbs are on. Thus moving backwards from both states, we arrive at T2-T1, where all bulbs are on again.</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":127,"difficulty":"medium","category":"discrete","title":"Light Bulbs in circle"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":127,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/126","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/medium/128","difficulty":"medium"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
