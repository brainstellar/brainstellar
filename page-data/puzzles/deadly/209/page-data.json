Thus, total number of cards turned to see first ace = 1 + sum (Xi)\nusing linearity of expectation, E(X) = 1 + sum ( E(Xi))\nNow consider the ith card and the four aces, all the orders are equally likely: X,A,A,A,A Or A,X,A,A,A, or 3 others. They are equally likely when we have no knowledge about position of these Aces with respect of the deck. Hence we have 5 equally likely slots for ith card: 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5. We are interested in 1st slot.\nHence E(Xi) = 1/5 for all i = 1 to 48\nThus E(X) = 1 + 48/5 = 53/5 = 10.6</p>\n<p>This can be done by recursive equation  f(n) = (4/n) * 1 + ((n-4)/n) * (1+f(n-1)), where f(n)=expected cards to flip in a deck of n cards, but I definitely can't solve this without a computer.</p>\n<p>A shorter explanation is to consider the 52 cards uniformly distributed over (0,1), so on average they're at k/53 for k=1,2,3,…,52. The four aces are on average at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5. So 0.2=k/53 implies k=10.6, done!</p>","frontmatter":{"puzzleId":209,"difficulty":"hard","category":"probability","title":"Greed for an ACE"}}},"pageContext":{"puzzleId":209,"previousPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/hard/208","nextPuzzleRoute":"/puzzles/hard/210","difficulty":"hard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
